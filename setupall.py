"""A script to install in one of 3 modes:
(a) daemon - installs jmbase, jmdaemon
(b) client-only - installs jmbase, jmclient
(c) client-bitcoin - installs jmbase, jmclient, jmbitcoin
(d) all - installs jmbase, jmclient, jmbitcoin, jmdaemon
(e) develop - installs jmbase, jmclient, jmbitcoin, jmdaemon linked to the source directoy

Note that b and c are distinct mainly due to the fact that
the latter requires the secp256k1 (libsecp256k1 via the secp256k1-py binding),
which is something that would be an annoyance if you don't need it (wallets).
While only (a) has a similarly annoying dependency on libnacl as the binding
to libsodium.
All modes require and install twisted.
